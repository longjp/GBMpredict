## Survival Prediction for GBM

<img src="nomogram.png" align="right" width="440" />

Code for building a clinical and genomic predictive model (nomogram) for GBM survival. The resulting nomogram is available here [https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/shinyapps/GBM_Predict/](https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/shinyapps/GBM_Predict/).

This repository contains data cleaning, model construction, and validation code only, not the web-based nomogram itself. Due to data confidentiality issues, MD Anderson cohort data is not publicly available through this repository. As a result, the code in this repository cannot be executed. For access to the MD Anderson cohort data, please contact [Dr. Amy Heimberger](aheimber@mdanderson.org).
